## What's `nima`?

[R/nima](http://code.nimahejazi.org/nima) is an [R](http://www.r-project.org)
package comprised of miscellaneous personal tools that are useful to me. This
package is made public for my own convenience, with no guarantees whatsoever.
Accordingly, it will be regularly updated, possibly with breaking changes.
Despite this, I will make every effort to ensure that any R code relying on this
package is not broken by an update. That said, _caveat emptor_: use `nima` only
at your own risk. For complete documentation, consider consulting the website
accompanying the package [here](http://code.nimahejazi.org/nima).

## Installation

Install a recent _stable release_ from CRAN:

```{r cran-install, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("nima")
```

Install the stable _development version_ from GitHub via
[`devtools`](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/):

```{r gh-master-install, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("nhejazi/nima")
```
